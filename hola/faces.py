        Face traversal code adapted from
            http://mathoverflow.net/questions/23811/reporting-all-faces-in-a-planar-graph
        which in turn is an adaptation of routine from SAGE:
            http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/graphs/sage/graphs/generic_graph.html#sage.graphs.generic_graph.GenericGraph.faces

        As per discussion at the Mathoverflow page, it is a pretty simple idea:
           "
           I'll assume the graph is connected, and that you have the clockwise or
           counterclockwise ordering of the edges around each vertex. Then it's easy,
           given a directed edge e, to walk around the face whose counterclockwise boundary
           contains e. So make a list of all directed edges (i. e., two copies of each
           undirected edge). Pick one directed edge, walk counterclockwise around its face,
           and cross off all the directed edges you traverse. That's one face. Pick a
           directed edge you haven't crossed off yet and walk around its face the same way.
           Keep doing that until you've crossed off all of the edges. (Note that the
           "counterclockwise" boundary of the exterior unbounded face actually goes clockwise
           around the outside of the graph.)
